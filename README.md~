This Project Allocation System is done using java **NetBeans IDE**. The Raw Netbeans installation can run this project without any external add-ons.

Also there is a **Stand Alone Binary** which can be run from the terminal itself.

- NetBeans -> Run -> Run(ProjectAllocationSystem)
- ** This should give you a pop up with GUI **

- Select Browse -> [*path to Project file*/Olympians/projectallocationsystem/src/projectallocationsystem/projectAllocationData.tsv] -> Select OK
- Select Execute Button on the GUI Main Interface
- Genetic Algorithm Result is in the *default* tab
- Select Simulated Annealing Tab -> ** This view contains the Simulated Annealing Result Table **

** Export to PDF **

- Select Print PDF From UI
- Select *Print to PDF* in Pop Up Print Dialog
- Enter Output File Name [Example : *Genetic-Algorithm-Results*] -> Save

## Stand Alone Execution [Fail Safe] ##

This is a pre compiled java project [classes] file that you can just run through the terminal or the command line. You just have to compile the Main Class to work in your computer.

- Open a **terminal or cmd**
- Navigate to [*path to project file*/projectallocationsystem/stand-alone/projectallocationsystem/]
- **For GUI** - Run Command [ javac -d . UI.java ] *compile the User Interface Main Class*
- **For Terminal or cmd Output** - Run Command [ javac -d . ProjectAllocationSystem.java ] *compile the Terminal Output Interface Main Class*

- **To Run GUI** - Run Command - [ java projectallocationsystem/UI ] *Run the command for UI Program execution*
- **For Terminal or cmd Output Report Output** - [ java projectallocationsystem.ProjectAllocationSystem ] *Run the command for Terminal Report Output*

**Note : This is only if the NetBeans Cannot be opened in the target machine**
